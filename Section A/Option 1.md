## Option 1: Python Task
### Correctness
The solution will throw an [IndentationError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndentationError) because of the block of code from line 3 to line 10. After this has been fixed, it will throw [TypeError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError) because the [sorted](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted) method expects at least one parameter. Overall the solution is correct after the errors have been fixed it will work as expected. The solution creates a dictionary where it uses the sorted string from **strs** as the key, it then appends the original string to the dictionary if the key already exists or a new key-value pair is created in the dictionary with the sorted letters of the word as the key and the word itself as the value.
### Efficiency
The python sorted method uses the Timsort sorting algorithm which has the time complexity O(n log n) in the worst case, where n would be the length of the word. The sorted method is called m times, where m is the length of the strings array. The overall time efficiency of the solution would be O( mn log n)
### Style
Other than the initial indetantion mistake that happened the rest of the code was properly indented. Python generally follows the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style guidelines and the coode does adhere to the guideline. The improvement that could be done is to name the other variables(i,x, and strs) meaningfully. Example of meaningful names for the variables could be:
strs -> words
i -> word  
x -> sorted_letters  

### Documentation
Both the class and the method could benefit from using docstrings to explain their intended use. The class docstring could look like this:
```Python
class Solution:
""" 
A class that provides a method for grouping a list of words into anagrams.

Methods: 
	groupAnagrams(strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

"""
# Code implementation
```
The docstring for the method could look like this:
```Python
def groupAnagrams(self, words): 
""" 
Groups a list of words into anagrams and returns the groups as a list of lists.

Args:
	words: A list of strings to group into anagrams. Returns: A list of lists, where
		    each inner list contains a group of anagrams from the input list. 
"""
# Code implementation
```
Comments could also be highly beneficial as they would give a clear indication of what the code's intended functionality is.
